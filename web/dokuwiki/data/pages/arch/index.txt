====== Arch Linux ======

===== Pros =====

  * Rolling release((Versions of various linux distributions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions#General)).
  * Independent distribution.
  * Large community + amount of packages in repositories + pentesting tools((BlackArch tools: https://www.blackarch.org/tools.html.)).
  * Binary based.
  * Pacman.
  * CLI installation.
  * Only 1 kernel name for each kernel type (no version strings afterwards).

===== Cons =====

  * SystemD.
  * Processor architecture support (amd64).
  * Unstable.
  * AUR.
  * Not respecting FSF - not differentiating between open-source and non-free software. Kernel contains binary blobs.
  * Glibc only - no musl support. GNU dependant.
