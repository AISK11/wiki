====== Debian Linux ======

===== Pros =====

  * Processor architecture support (amd64, i386, arm64, armhf, armel...)((Debian supported processor architectures: https://wiki.debian.org/SupportedArchitectures.)).
  * Amount of maintainers, userbase + amount of packages in repositories((Package management across different linux distributions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions#Package_management_and_installation.)).
  * Independent distribution.
  * Stability.
  * Binary based.
  * Respecting FSF but allowing non-FSF software if necessary((Debian kernel vs Linux-libre: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/288027/what-are-the-differences-between-debian-linux-kernel-and-linux-libre.)).

===== Cons =====

  * SystemD.
  * Point release + package manager.
  * Graphical installation.
  * Messy official website.
