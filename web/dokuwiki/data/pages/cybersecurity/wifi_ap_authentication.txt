===== Theory =====

==== Electromagnetic Waves ====

[{{:cybersecurity:waves.png?nolink&600 |Electromagnetic waves do not need a medium to propagate and in vacuum travel at the speed of light (//299,792,458 m/s// or //1,079,252,848.8 km/h//).}}]

[{{ :cybersecurity:wlan-formula-frequency.png?nolink&300 |Frequency formula. The smaller the wavelength (distance) - the higher the frequency (speed).}}]

[{{ :cybersecurity:wlan-singal-strength.png?nolink&300 |The greater the wave amplitude - the stronger the signal. 3 dBm change - power doubling (2x). 10 dBm change - power decupling (10x).}}]

==== Wi-Fi Channels ====

[{{:cybersecurity:wlan-2ghz-channels.png?nolink&600 |Wi-Fi channel allocation across 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum used in 802.11b/g/n/ax standards.}}]

[{{:cybersecurity:wlan-5ghz-channels.png?nolink&600 |Wi-Fi channel allocation across 5 GHz frequency spectrum used in 802.11a/n/ac/ax standards.}}]

==== Wi-Fi WNIC Operation Modes ====

[{{ :cybersecurity:wlan-service-sets.png?nolink&600 |Wi-Fi service sets.}}]

  *Master - AP.
  *Managed - client/station/supplicant.
  *Monitor - RFMON.

==== Wi-Fi Frame types ====

   -**Management frames:** managing BSS (probing, associating, roaming, disconnecting).
    *Beacon - passive scanning.
    *Probe request/response - active scanning.
    *Association request/response - request to join BSS.
    *Reassociation request/response - used in roaming.
    *Disassociation.
    *Authentication.
    *Deauthentication.
    *Action.
  -**Control frames:**
    *RTS - request to send.
    *CTS - clear to send.
    *ACK - acknowledgement.
    *Block ACK
    *Block ACK Request.
    *PS Poll.
  -**Data frames:**
    *Data.
    *QoS Data.
